[{"username": "bendmorris", "comment": "In my field (ecology and evolutionary biology) there's a small but concerted push to get people to publish \\\"executable papers\\\" where all code and data is available via GitHub, on an iPython notebook, etc. so that all figures and test cases can easily be reproduced by reviewers and researchers.
